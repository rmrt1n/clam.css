# [WIP] clam.css

This is yet another classless / minimal / lightweight CSS framework. I always
find myself copy-pasting styles from my old code to my new projects. It can be
time consuming at times and a hassle. I wanted something that I could use to set
up my projects quickly with my prefered styles, so I can focus on other parts of
my app.
